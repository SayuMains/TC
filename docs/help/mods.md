# Moderator Help | TCN Global Chat

## Removing unwanted content
If you want to purge a message from a global chat, just delete it, and it will be removed from all connected servers.\
Using a purge command to remove messages in bulk should work too, but may take a few seconds.

## Banning users from a global chat
The `/ban` command can be used to ban a user from a global chat. Messages sent to a connected channel by that user will be deleted, and blocked from being relayed to connected servers. To get a user's ID, right-click or tap-and-hold a message, and under `Apps` choose `user`.

To unban a user from a global chat, use the `/unban` command.

## Panic mode
If a global channel is being spammed or raided, you can instantly switch it off using the `/panic` command. Note that only a TCN observer can turn panic mode off.\
**Using this command pings all observers. Misuse may result in a ban from all global channels.**
