# Exec Help | TCN Global Chat

The owner of this bot, and members of the executive council are the only users allowed to add and remove global chats.\
They also have the permission to connect or disconnect global channels in servers that are not in the partner list.

## Adding a new global channel
Sometimes server collabs are quite interactive, but there is no good way for everyone to talk to each other, so the conversations usually get split between two channels, one in each server.\
To solve this issue, new global channels can be created on demand, and connected to a small part of the network. A global channel can be created with the `/globals add` command.

## Removing a global channel
If a global channel is not being used anymore, for example because a collab has ended, it can be deleted with the `/globals remove` command.

## Changing the log channel
You can change where log messages for a global channel get sent with the `/globals logchannel` command.
