# Admin Help | TCN Global Chat

Your global channel was probably connected by the developer of this bot, or by a member of the executive council. You are free to connect to and disconnect from it however, in case you want to switch the channel it's connected to, or want to add a global channel you don't have yet.

## Connecting a to a global channel
To connect to a global channel, use the `/connect` command. This will show a modal with a textbox with `TCN` written inside. You probably don't need to change this, and can just press the submit button.
