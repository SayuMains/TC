# Global Chat Rules
These are the rules for the global chat. If you're chatting in the global chat, you should follow these rules, as well as the rules of the server you're sending messages from.

If you disagree with any of these rules, please contact `Leaf#1950`.

## 1. Respect each other
No harrassment, discrimination or personal attacks.

## 2. No NSFW
If your server is lenient with this, that doesn't mean all connected servers are.

## 3. No leaks
Leaks are not allowed in the global chat, and should instead be discussed in a channel your server allows leaks in.

## 4. No drama
So don't complain about your ban/mute in another server.
Talking about topics like politics or religion is also discouraged, because they turn into drama fast.
<!-- If you have a complaint about a TCN server, you can join the [TCN Hub](<invite>) and send a message to our modmail bot. -->

## 5. No spam
This includes server-hopping, sending a message from each server you're hopping to.

## 6. No self-promotion
The global chat exists to chat, not to advertize. 

## 7. English only
Please don't have conversations in other languages than English, other languages can't be moderated consistently.
Small well-known phrases and memes are allowed to be in other languages.

## 8. Listen to the mods
These rules are guidelines and are not complete. In the end, moderators decide.
If you think a moderator made a mistake, please contact `Leaf#1950`.
