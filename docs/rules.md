# Global Chat Rules

## Respect each other.
You shouldn't care that much about something that doesn't affect you.

## No NSFW.
Need I say more?

## Don't complain about punishments.
Don't talk about you getting muted, banned, etc in any of the network's servers,
talking in the global chat with them connected is *already* sort of evading your punishment.
