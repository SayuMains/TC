# TCN Global Chat FAQ

## What is this channel?
This channel is a relay channel. This means that any message you send here is sent to a bunch of other servers all across the TCN, and messages from other servers are sent here.

## Why is everyone else a bot?
The relaying of messages is done by a bot, using webhooks. Webhooks can choose a username and profile picture per message they send, so they can use the name and pfp of another user, but they'll always have the little bot tag behind their name to show that they're not actual users, but automated systems.
